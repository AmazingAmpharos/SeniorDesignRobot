# SeniorDesignRobot
A repository showing the codebase behind a maze navigating, peg fetching robot from a school project.

The Arduino code is included in full here. This code includes a lot of hard-coded voltages given to motors to specify drive speed, and it relies primarily on sonic sensors to determine its position which is used for determining drive time. The overall task was to navigate a maze to locate certain pegs, located in partially random locations, grab the pegs, identify the colors of the pegs, and return the pegs to the proper box.

An image of the robot is also included. I do not know at which stage of development the image is from, but it's far enough that it's essentially complete.

A video of a test drive from fairly far but not the end of development can be found here:

This run errors out after failing to find the fourth peg, but it successfully grabs and returns three. This is not from the final code, but it's very late development code and the latest video of the robot in action that has not been lost to time.
